An AI-powered web application for detecting common eye diseases using retinal images. Built with TensorFlow.js and Teachable Machine.

## Project Overview

Eye disease detection is a critical global conce.rn, with increasing cases of vision impairment posing significant health and socio-economic challenges. Traditional diagnostic methods relying on manual examination are time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. This Automatic Eye Disease Detection System addresses these challenges through an AI-driven solution that automates disease identification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system detects three major eye diseases: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and Cataracts, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention.

## Key Features

- ü©∫ **AI-Powered Diagnosis: CNN-based detection of 3 major eye diseases**

- ‚ö° **Real-Time Analysis: Instant classification of retinal images**

- üìä **Interactive Results: Visual confidence scores and severity indicators**

- üìÅ **Report Generation: Downloadable PDF reports with detailed analysis**

- üí¨ **Clinical Guidance: Post-diagnosis recommendations and next steps**

- üì± **Responsive Web Interface: Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices**
